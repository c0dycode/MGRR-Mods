I've decided it might be a neat idea to have a dedicated discord server for my projects.

# Usage
Atm inject DLL via any Injector. CheatEngine can do that.

Alternatively: Rename the DLL to "DbgHelp.dll" and copy next to the MGR exe.

Alternative 2: Use The [DLLPluginLoader](https://github.com/c0dycode/DLLPluginLoader/releases/download/1.3/ddraw.dll) and rename it to "DbgHelp.dll" and create a "Plugins"-folder and put the "MGR.dll" in there

Then, press the PAUSE-key to open up the overlay and to use the mouse, open the pause menu.

Changing the BP/Currency works fine if you enter the values manually, the +/- buttons need to be held down for some reason.
